<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A bonbon is a sweet or small confection, especially a small ball coated in chocolate. The word originated from the French language and simply means "candy", where the first reports of bonbons come from the 17th century, when they were made at the French royal court</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup Margarine</li>
        <li>2 Lbs Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Can Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>3 Cups Coconut</li>
        <li>1 Cup Walnut</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>12 Ounce Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Shortening</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In large bowl, combine margarine, confectioners' sugar, condensed milk, coconut, chopped walnuts and vanilla. Stir well. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or until mixture has thickened enough to roll into balls. Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls and place close together, but not touching, on cookie sheets. Freeze until hard.</li>
        <li>While bonbons are freezing, line a cookie sheet or flat surface with waxed paper. Combine chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler, over, not in, simmering water. Stir until melted. Using a toothpick or a fork, dip each bonbon in the melted chocolate. Place on waxed paper to dry. When chocolate has hardened, store bonbons in plastic bag in the freezer.</li>
