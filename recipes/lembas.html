<h1>Description</h1>
<p> "Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith."
    â€”The Fellowship of the Ring, "Farewell to Lorien"</p>

        <li>Finally add the cream, honey, and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness. Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.Criss-cross each square from corner-to-corner with a knife, lightly (not cutting through the dough).</li>
        <li>
            Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before eating, this bread tastes better room temperature and dry. Also for more flavor you can add more cinnamon or other spices</li>
